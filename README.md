👋 Hey there! I'm Mumair, a finance and data enthusiast with a passion for leveraging technology to drive impactful solutions. I hold a Masters in Finance and a Graduate Certification in FinTech Innovation from J. Mack Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, complemented by an immersive apprenticeship in data analytics from the Institute of Emerging Careers.

💼 My professional journey spans over six dynamic years, traversing teaching, administration, and finance internships. Through this diverse background, I've honed a deep expertise in financial reporting, accounting, company valuation, and investment analysis techniques. Additionally, I've delved into the realms of data analytics and fintech, culminating in a hands-on hedge fund simulation that provided invaluable exposure to the intricacies of the US stock market.

💡 I've had the privilege to serve as the financial lead at Resilience Inc., a US-based non-profit, and Algorizin, a US-based staffing company. These roles not only sharpened my ability to navigate complex financial landscapes but also fostered a keen understanding of driving organizational growth through strategic financial management.

🌍 Armed with a dual Masters in Business Administration and Finance from Pakistan, I bring a global perspective to problem-solving and business strategy. As a reentry mom rekindling my career flame, I'm on the lookout for a dynamic role that harmonizes my expertise in finance and data analytics.

🔍 My strength lies in problem-solving, refined through a myriad of experiences, coupled with recent immersions in fintech projects. I'm excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to your organization, contributing to your team's success.

🚀 Let's connect! I'm enthusiastic about exploring opportunities to collaborate and discuss how my background aligns with your goals. Thank you for considering my profile!
